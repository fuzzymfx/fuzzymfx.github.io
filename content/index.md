Hi, I am Anubhab Patnaik, a CS engineer from India. Interested in math, science, and engineering, I work with software engineering and try to solve real-world problems. This is a space where I publish my thoughts and ideas. I write about tech, science, and my life. [Here's my background](/background.html) and [here's what I am up to these days](/current.html).

I work with whatever piques my interest. I used to dabble in ML and now work with web, mobile, and CMD applications. I polish my DS and algo on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/anubhabr50). This site is built using my custom SSG, [zuzu](https://github.com/fuzzymfx/zuzu). Lately, I've been working on a custom bit-torrent client to download files using TypeScript, and I plan on porting it to Rust. Meanwhile, I am also exploring esoteric programming languages and will work on a brainfuck interpreter soon.

When not coding up a storm, I work with FOSS communities: I conduct workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions. [cbrtl](https://cbrtl.github.io) is a platform for students to showcase their skills and get recognition for their work.

Besides, I love listening to music, watching sci-fi, sitcoms, fantasy and thriller, and reading books. I have recently started playing the guitar, and I have been reading the `Remembrance of Earth's Past` by Liu Cixin. I love to travel and [click a lot of photos](https://instagram.com/anubhavclicks). I attend seminars on space exploration, life in space, and physics. I also participate in debates and MUNs and dabble in freelance graphic design. Whether geeky, nerdy, or creative, I'm always up for it!
