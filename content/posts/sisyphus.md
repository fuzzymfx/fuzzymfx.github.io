Greek mythology is fascinating, full of stories that explore the human condition and the nature of existence. My fascination with it stems from the fact that even gods are flawed. They are not perfect beings, but rather, subject to the same emotions and desires as mortals—capricious, unpredictable, and often facing unintended consequences from their actions. Zeus, the king of the gods, is known for his infidelity and vengeful nature. Hera, his wife, embodies jealousy and vindictiveness, while Aphrodite, the goddess of love, is vain and manipulative.

Mortals, gods, and monsters alike are bound by the whims of fate; lives marked by joy and triumph, but also by tragedy and suffering. Each of us has our own personal myth that we live out every day, a prophecy to fulfil. 

Sisyphus, the king of Ephyra, was punished by Zeus for cheating death twice. He was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, doomed to repeat this task for eternity, never able to complete it. I see the myth of Sisyphus as a metaphor for the futility of life and the eternal journey to find purpose in a world that is indifferent to our existence. A never-ending quest, a journey fraught with constant change and uncertainty.

---

My journey throughout these years has been quite similar. Not because I am being punished by Zeus for cheating death, but because I find myself constantly building a new life in a new corner of the world, pushing a new boulder up a new hill.

Each journey represents a new beginning, a fresh start in a different city, where I find myself building a new life, making new friends, and indulging in new cultures. The ascent is filled with hope and possibility. Trying to find my place in the newfound world, building relationships, and creating memories. Eventually, the boulder rolls back down, signalling the inevitable need to move again, leaving behind what I've built and starting afresh. Empty houses - ones filled with laughter and joy, shops that let me pay later since I was a regular, now closed, replaced with malls and supermarkets, temples, churches and mosques, now distant memories, neighbours who became family, and friends who became strangers. 

### Bhubaneswar: The Early Years

My earliest memories are rooted in Bhubaneswar. I must have been two or three at that time. I remember how my mother looked then. She had a white dress that I was very fond of. I remember looking at the mirror my mother used to comb her hair in. It was a small, round mirror with a wooden frame. She used to take me with her everywhere. My father had a Suzuki Max 100. I had this inexplicable urge to sit on the fuel tank. It made me feel like I was the rider and in control of the bike. The lucid memories of faint incense sticks, the snug bed I slept in, nestled between my parents, and the blue tricycle I rode in feel like a different lifetime now — pieces of a world I left behind every time we moved. *Blue*, because I remember it was blue, and my cousin-sister had a red one, but she managed to break hers. Our mothers asked us to share the one I had. She had a knack for breaking most of her things. Chewed, scratched or demolished in forms beyond recognition. We were colour-coded. All my things, from my tiffin and a huge water bottle to my pencils, were blue. Hers were red.

We are six months apart, my cousin-sister and me. Every day, my mother would pick us up from school, and once we were home, she'd make us sit on the floor for lunch. For reasons I still don't fully understand, I always took an absurdly long time to finish my meal—it could stretch anywhere from one to three hours. The afternoon naps were floaty and euphoric, still lucid in my memory. They still help me transcend space and time. We had this incredible Sony music system, and we both had a routine. The same music CD used to play every afternoon, and we were asleep by the end of the second song. That's why I could only remember the first two songs on the CD. *Ja re bhasi jaa*, and *Jajabara*.

The irony of listening to that song is that it always made more and more sense as I grew up, and the less I heard growing up. Quite similar to the myth of Sisyphus, a masterclass of a poem and epitome of Odia literature, [Jajabara](https://music.apple.com/us/album/jajabara-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-ep/1380220136) is a poem about a nomadic lifestyle, author describing his journey through the world, and the world being a stage. The poet refers to their mind as a wanderer- someone who constantly roams or seeks something beyond the immediate reality. It speaks about the poet's hopes or aspirations are limitless, indicating a deep longing or an unquenchable thirst for something greater, a cyclical nature of life where values or rules are constantly created and discarded, indicating the transient nature of human beliefs and the constant change in perspectives over time. It uses vivid imagery of a sandcastle to represent dreams or aspirations, which are beautiful yet fragile and temporary, easily washed away by the tides of reality.

Those lazy afternoons of napping to music now feel like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities.

This was when my parents were starting a family, much like I find myself doing in a few years now. As I write this, my same sister is preparing for her wedding next month, marking yet another cycle of life. In a year or two, her kids would be listening to Arijit Singh while taking a nap. It's strange how nostalgia grips you—reminding you that what once felt like yesterday is now a memory of a distant past.

I do not remember a lot about the time there, for I was too young. Each time we packed up and left, I saw the boulder rolling back down. We started building a new life in a different city. The cycle of moving and rebuilding continued, each time leaving behind a piece of myself. 

### Kolkata: Tram Rides and Power Rangers

We moved to Kolkata in 2004. My father's job took us there. Leaving behind my grandparents was difficult. They told me stories and magical tales of morality and ethics. Each of my four grandparents, from both my mother's and father's side, had lived over half a century, carrying a treasure trove of experiences, perspectives, and memories that they were always eager to share.

Their stories weren't just simple fables but windows into worlds shaped by time and wisdom. My maternal grandfather worked in the Secretariat, while my paternal grandfather had been the Director of Education in Odisha. Both of my grandmothers were teachers, though my father's mother left her profession after marriage, while my mother's mother continued teaching. They filled my head with wandering tales of the past, of a time when the world was simpler, and life moved at a slower pace.

We were given quarters in the company's colony in Tollygunge, a small, close-knit space that quickly became home. The colony had just two modest buildings, side by side, separated by a narrow passage that led to a small backyard. At the end of this passage, tucked against the wall, was a bench where you could sit and feel the world slow down. One side was flanked by the buildings, the other by a tall barrier that seemed to enclose our little world.

The watchman, Biswanath, was a constant presence, a quiet guardian of the colony. His living space was tiny, almost like a matchbox tucked under the stairs. He had a small, well-loved radio that crackled with music or news, and it fascinated me. I'd often sit with him, watching the road as he listened to his radio, content in the stillness.

We couldn't roam around on our bikes as freely as we used to, the streets of Kolkata felt too busy, too vast. Luckily, the main road I lived by had a tram stop near the mosque, and my memories of tram rides are still vivid. They were lovely. I remember how the ticket looked, the old paper with a red border, and the sounds of the bells; the bus conductor used to pull a rope tied to the roof, which was connected to a bell. The bell would ring, and the tram would stop. Slowly settling into the busy, loud Kolkata life, the tram rides were a welcome respite, a chance to slow down and watch the world pass by.

The mosque was situated in the middle of the road. I used to figure out play time by listening to the *azaan*. Four-thirty in the afternoon was the time to go out and play. On the other side of the road was a sweet shop. Kolkata was a world much bigger than what we were used to. The transition was already difficult for us, Odiyas, as we did not understand Bengali, and Kolkata was adamant about making us learn it. 

Kolkata was kind and homely. The streets buzzed with life, a symphony of clattering trams, honking taxis, and the vibrant hum of people filling every corner. The smells of street food mixed with the scent of incense from nearby temples, and the narrow lanes wound through neighborhoods like veins through the heart of the city, each turn leading to a different world.

We explored the city mostly by metro, and according to my mother, every trip to a station sparked an odd obsession in me—the escalators. I couldn't resist them. I'd race up and down the same one, completely captivated, much to my father's chagrin. In those days, corporal punishment was a common response to disobedience, and each time I ran wild on the escalator, I knew what awaited me. Still, each and every time, I couldn't resist the pull of the moving stairs. I had to try and see if I could walk upstairs faster than the escalator. I never could.

My sister was born in 2005, and we spent the next two years in Kolkata. I am unsure as to how I felt about her arrival. I was five and a half. With time, I remember the feeling of having to share my parents with her, which was new and strange. 

During this time, *Manju*, our maid, used to take care of me. She, and her daughter, *Mampi* used to babysit me and my sister. She was kind and loving, often shielding me from my mother's scolding when I refused to study in the evenings. She even stood up for me when the colony kids bullied me. My mother had less mobility. She had to take care of my sister. While she couldn't take me everywhere like she used to, I used to roam around with my father. He bought me all kinds of things, and he still does. I believe my father, mother and I will always be together in all kinds of worlds. He would always get me things I wanted, on this earth, those are materialistic gadgets or probably food. Maybe somewhere in a different timeline, in some galaxy far away, he might get me a meteorite, or maybe a spaceship! He is overly sensitive, and emotional and has a ton of wisdom to share.

I remember this one time I got lost in Victoria Memorial. My mother's friend was visiting us, and we went to the Victoria Memorial. I was holding his hand, gazing at the stars and walking straight. They seemed to follow me as if looking straight at me. I was fascinated by the stars, and I still am. They felt like a nomadic tribe, wandering the sky, telling stories of the past, much like *Jajabara*.

Somewhere, Father left my hand and had to take out his purse. Oblivious, I kept walking straight, and when I turned back, I couldn't see him. I started crying. I was lost. An extremely kind family offered me help and asked for my father's number. They even offered me ice cream, but I was too shaken to eat anything. 

Mother never let me go to Victoria Memorial again. I have had the closest bond with my mother. I feel like she had always been my mother in all other worlds, loving, pushing me to get a 100/100 in exams for only God knows what reason, and constantly opposed to whatever I wanted to do for they might be dangerous or expensive. Although, when the time comes, it might be easier to convince her to ask for a spaceship. Father might be hesitant, but she has a knack for getting things done from him. I could go on and on about my mother, and her love and reluctance to let me eat outside food and buy gadgets, but I will save that for another time. 

Looking back, I realize how simple everything was back then. The world felt small, and the days stretched endlessly. The transient inevitability of the non-linear passage of time was yet to dawn on me. Days were longer. Surrounded by family and relatives, life never felt lonely. My sister, who once fit snugly in my arms, is nineteen now. Back then, the world was a playground, and I was the king of the castle.

I had a Nintendo and spent hours playing Mario, Duck Hunt, and Contra. I loved watching Power Rangers, Doraemon, and other cartoons. We'd often rent VCDs from the local store, and I remember this one time being especially excited about Dhoom 2, while my mother was eager to watch Veer-Zaara. Back then, a single disk usually contained three movies, so it was always a mix of genres and tastes, making movie nights an adventure of their own. Movies were an escape from reality, although I didn't understand half of what the story was about. I was more interested in the action sequences.

The most memorable part of living in Kolkata would be the train journeys to and from Kolkata to Bhubaneswar. We often visited our home in Bhubaneswar, and I loved the train journeys at night. The train used to halt before entering West Bengal and my dad used to bring food from the *Kharagpur Station*. I feel that the journeys in my life have always made me feel better. They helped me live multiple lives, one in Kolkata, and the other in the places I used to visit. During the journey, we halted at various cities, with each having a different relative, friend, and a story to tell of its own. 

The train journeys were a time for introspection, a time to reflect on the past and plan for the future. The rhythmic sound of the train on the tracks was soothing, and the gentle rocking motion of the train was comforting. They were a time to disconnect from the world and connect with myself, a time to dream, to imagine, and to create. Quite similar to the journey of life, pushing on boulders up multiple hills, watching them roll back, trains stopping at stations, and then moving on, pausing for a moment, a few months, maybe years, before hopping on another train, in another city, on another journey.

The boulder was yet to roll down, and a new hill was yet to be scaled. The memories of Kolkata are etched in my mind, a time of innocence and wonder, a time of exploration and discovery. 

### Asansol: The New Beginning

In 2007, I found myself packed with bags, my mother and distant cousin uncles, in Asansol, yet again starting from the bottom of a different hill, a new boulder this time.

My father was busy with tours. His job demanded a lot of tours. This eternal movement in my fate, my Sisyphean journey was due to the fact that my father's job required him to move every two and a half years. Looking back, it was difficult, the constant moving and rebuilding lives in different cities.

### Jajpur: Encounter with rural life

Yet again, I found myself in a new, unfamiliar world. I was nine years old now, and my parents seemed genuinely happy. Moving to Jajpur, a small town in Odisha, meant we were closer to Bhubaneswar, making frequent visits to our extended family much easier. My grandparents were overjoyed; they could see us more often, visiting every weekend and sometimes staying with us for extended periods. This was a welcome change for all of us.

Our new move was peaceful and we gradually started settling down. I was in fourth grade noew, and attending *Harrow Public School*. The school was small, with a playground that was more of a dust bowl. The school itself was housed in a large, unfinished two-story building. The first floor was divided into two sections: a vast hall accommodating four different classes without any partitions, and a smaller room designated for the primary grades—first, second, and third. 

I was introduced to my native, Odia language in a very raw form. The prayers, scripts and literature was a bit difficult for me to grasp,  since other students have been learning the language for a long time then. Despite, the culture felt deeply personal and heartfelt. I loved shopping from the nearby store, snacking on *Gupchup* and *Dahi Bara Aloo Dum*.

The exciting part was witnessing sixth and seventh grade students getting disciplined by the teachers. Beating up students till they turned red was an essential discipline technique in an uneducated, rural town. The teachers were strict, and the students were rowdy. The school was a mix of students from different backgrounds. Some were from the town, while others were from the nearby villages. I was excited joining the school, since this school allowed students to use pens in the fourth grade and that is what mattered to me the most; pen users were the elite, and being able to scribble with a pen was a significant rite of passage. 

Jajpur life was slow, peaceful, and simple. The town was small, with narrow lanes and small shops. The small town, with its narrow lanes and quaint shops, was enveloped by lush paddy fields. The air was rich with the scent of fresh earth and filled with the sound of birds. The evenings were cool, filled with the chorus of crickets, children playing, and the temple bells ringing. Nights were serene and quiet. The town was a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city, a place where time moved at its own pace. We rented a house and settled in, making it our home. The weekends were a ride to Bhubaneswar, and the weekdays were spent in school.

This new life also was my entrance into the world of music and rhythm. The house owner's daughter used to learn classical music, and both my parents, advent music lovers, wanted me to get into music, naturally. I was enrolled in *Tabla* classes and her tabla teacher was entrusted with teaching me Tabla. My mother had a fascination with the instrument. I was surprisingly really good at it. I was a natural, and I loved it.

Transitioning from a place where I had countless friends to a new home with hardly any children nearby was a strange and difficult adjustment. It was my first real encounter with loneliness. The few children who lived near us attended a different school—a more polished institution, perhaps, but one that seemed less focused on education. In the evenings, I spent most of my time alone, watching TV, playing on computers, or just wandering around the house. The loneliness was palpable, a constant companion that followed me everywhere. I missed my friends, the laughter, the games, and the camaraderie. I missed the sense of belonging that comes with being part of a community.

My most favourite memory has to be the journey back to home. We would travel in our Hyundai Getz Prime, taking the four-hour drive to Bhubaneswar. The route was picturesque, winding through lush green fields, quaint villages, and increasingly wider roads as we crossed cities. The journey was a time to bond with my family, to talk about lives lived in the 70s, 80s and 90s, to laugh, and to share stories. A time to reflect and plan for the future, a time to dream, to imagine, and to create. The soundtrack to these memories was the Odia songs from the CD my father bought, featuring the soulful music of Akshaya Mohanty. I still remember the order of the songs and the lyrics, each one etching itself into my memory.

There is something profoundly liberating about being on the road, in motion, part of a journey. Much alike my sisyphean journey in life, roads are a metaphor for life, a journey fraught with constant change and uncertainty.

However, our time in Jajpur was brief. The rural setting, while peaceful, presented challenges for our family. Settling down proved difficult, and concerns about education and livelihood began to outweigh the town's tranquil allure. My parents decided it was best to move to Cuttack, as enrolling in a school in Bhubaneswar mid-year was impractical. The following year was thus spent in Cuttack, marking the beginning of yet another chapter in our ever-changing journey.

### Cuttack: Moving to a "city"

### Jamshedpur: Our longest oddyssey yet

Packed, yet again, I foundmyself in Jamshedpur. We stayed in Rajan bhai's place for a couple of days before our lease could be finalised. Meeting him again was extremely nostalgic and exciting. Life in Jamshedpur was of a time of absolute growth and transformation. I was in the sixth grade now, and the transition felt familiar. We were used to this by now, the constant moving and rebuilding. The cycle of life, the journey of Sisyphus, was a part of our existence.

*...to be continued*

*...*

This one time while returning back from home, I also got my first pet, Toffee.  Reminiscing about Toffee feels surreal, as if we were siblings in another life, in a distant past. She was a beautiful Dalmatian—the sweetest, most obedient dog—with an infinite capacity for love that transcends space and time. My sister picked her up from our neighbors in Bhubaneswar as we were heading back to Jamshedpur; she was a gift from them. Initially, I was skeptical. I had never had pets and wasn't particularly fond of animals. But during that four-hour ride back to Jamshedpur, Toffee became an endless source of affection, quickly weaving herself into the fabric of our family.

The sad part of this story is that Toffee was taken away from us. My mother said it was too much for her to manage—a dog and two young children. Even now, I struggle to understand what was so difficult. She was such a sweet soul, potty trained and obedient. I remember the weekend we returned to Bhubaneswar to drop her off. My aunt was excited; she loved Toffee and wanted to keep her, which was the agreed-upon plan. The nine-year-old me was okay with this arrangement since Toffee would still be part of the family. But, unbeknownst to us, my uncle and grandfather had hatched a different sinister plan. They gave her away when my aunt was not home.

Life moved on. Life in Jamshedpur was consuming enough, back then. The gravity of the separation hadn't hit me, yet. Now, years later, it feels completely devastating. Missing Rio, and knowing how much he misses me, back at home, I could only begin to imaging the turmoil that Toffee must have gone through while separating. She loved us a lot. It is difficult for dogs to undetstand and process complex and synical human emotions. Looking back, remembering her fondly makes it more and more evident of the void that she left in my heart, and how unfair life had been to her. From being in a loving family to living with the extented family to being given away, and for no absolute fault of her own. It makes more and more sense that us humans, we don't deserve animals; pure unadulterated love, affection and loyalty. Our race, we are simply just not worthy of them. God must have made a mistake, creating such pure souls in a world so full of hate and deceit. Here, alone in New York, I think about her a lot; her indefinite showering of love and affection, and pray to be reunited in some form of life, next. Now that adulthood has set in, I recognize the emptiness her loss created within me. This encounter with grief was brief when I was a child, but having a new pet now brings everything back.

There's something magical about memories—how they transcend time and space, how they linger in the corners of our minds, waiting to be revisited, shaping and defining us. I've come to understand that grief is not linear. Dealing with it is a continuous, non-linear, multi-dimensional process. As I look back on past events, I'm finally beginning to process them. It becomes increasingly more evident of certain reppurcussions of the past that I was never fully able to understand earlier. t suddenly made sense why I am so attached to Rio and why the thought of losing him is so frightening. Now, fifteen years later, my heart is processing the grief of losing Toffee and the void she left behind. The memories of her are etched in my mind—a time of innocence, love, and affection.

Certain incidents in life now make more sense, like the time I unexpectedly broke down in front of my friends. He was breaking up with his girlfriend, and my job there was to console and support him. Between seeing him in pain, with red and wet eyes, there was something that triggered within me. I suddenly was overwhelmed and for the life of me I could never fully process and understand why. While I was close to both of them and played a significant role in their relationship, my reaction seemed disproportionate. Now that my internal strategy of dealing with grief was evident, I realized that the separation from Khusi was not something that I had processed fully. It wasn't until I saw them going through the same rite of passage that I had gone through, that I suddenly felt a familiar pang.

My process of dealing with grief is something I've only recently begun to understand, and it remains an ongoing journey. It brings a sense of peace. It might seem unusually weak—a twenty-four-year-old man, strong enough to leave behind his high-paying job for the current market, friends and entire family and start life from scratch in perhaps the world's most costiliest city, New York, with a loan of over a hundered thousand, suddenly breaking down in front of his friends and then choosing to write about it. But this vulnerability feels healing. This is what it looks like from within.

<!-- Growing up feels a lot different. The world is a blur now, a constant rush of deadlines, meetings, and responsibilities. I see weeks, months passing by in a blink. Looking at the mirror, it feels like I am staring at a stranger. The facial structure seems familiar, but the eyes, they seem different. They seem tired, weary, and lost, a distant echo of the child who once roamed the streets of Kolkata, played around in Asansol, and explored the lanes of Jamshedpur with his bestfriends. 

The memories of the past are distant, like echoes of a time before life sped up. Back then, the world seemed steady, but little did I know that soon, after moving countless boulders up various hills, I can't remember the last time I looked at an afternoon pass by.  -->


<!-- Ranking the hills, I find myself climbing, the boulders I push, and the memories I carry, I realize that life isn't about reaching the summit.

Ranking experiences are hard, but the order in which I felt peace, contentment, love and happiness are as follows: -->

<!-- 1. Jamshedpur
2. Asansol
3. Bhubaneswar: The Early Years
4. Cuttack: Moving to a "city" 
5. Kolkata: Tram Rides and Power Rangers
6. Jajpur: Encounter with rural life
7. Bhubaneswar: College Days
8. NYC: Adulting II
9. Bangalore: Adulting I
10. Hyderabad: The City of Pearls
11. Chandigarh: Darker Days
12. Bangalore: Covid-19 -->

<!-- Each time, I find myself answering the same question: what does this even achieve? It feels futile, like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of building and rebuilding, always searching for something that remains just out of reach. But perhaps that is the point. After years of pushing the boulder up countless hills, I've come to realize that life isn't about reaching the summit. Like Sisyphus, perhaps the struggle itself is where we find meaning—an endless journey of rediscovery, with memories and experiences as the boulders we carry along the way. It is about taking the sourest lemons life has to offer and turning it into something resembling lemonade.

Only memories remain, and the journey is all that matters. After all, that's all we are, really, memories. And memories are all we leave behind. -->
